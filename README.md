This repository contains a PHP function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart.  The original function lacks error handling for various scenarios, such as an empty input array or non-numeric values for price and quantity. The solution demonstrates how to improve the function with comprehensive error handling and input validation for better robustness and reliability.
